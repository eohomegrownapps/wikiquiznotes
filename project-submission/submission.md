An educational Android game which uses a Wikipedia article to create a multiple choice test.



**WikiQuiz** is an educational game which tries to generate questions on a topic you specify using a matching Wikipedia article. It utilises MediaWiki's API to request an article based on a topic then parses the page to find facts it can reliably understand using the Apache OpenNLG library, which it forms into questions using the simplenlg library (e.g. *"The Vikings were Scandinavian seafarers"* --> *"What were the Vikings?"*). Each question is presented with 3 answers, 1 being the correct one taken from the parsed sentence and the other 2 being 'dud' answers.



The program is written in **Java** targeting the **Android** platform.
